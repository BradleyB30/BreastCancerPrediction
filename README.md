## Breast Cancer Classification using Neural Network

In this project, we build a simple Neural Network (NN) for classifying breast cancer using TensorFlow and Keras in Python.

## Project Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women. Early detection and treatment can significantly improve the chances of survival. This project demonstrates how to build and train a neural network to classify breast cancer based on the features of cell nuclei present in breast cancer biopsies.
